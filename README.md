# Carbon-Copy
A challenging game of memorization

-first choose easy (3x3), medium (4x4), or hard (5x5) mode (or exit the game).

-And how many symbols you want [limit this to 6 with '0' being a space]; levels 1-5

-Finally, how much time you want the matrix to be displayed

-you are presented with a matrix for the chosen amount of time

-you try to input the matrix from memory

-this is compared to the original matrix and you are given a score based on getting the locations right and based on getting the symbols right. (Each position is, thus worth a possible 2 points).

-after being presented with your score, you then have the option to play again or quit.
