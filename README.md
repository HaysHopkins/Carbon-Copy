# Carbon-Copy
A challenging game of memorization

-first choose easy (8 seconds), medium (4 seconds), or hard (2 seconds) mode (or exit the game).

-then you choose how big of an area you want [maybe limit it to 10x10?] 

-and how many symbols you want [limit this to ~10 with a default extra being a space]

-you are presented with a matrix for the chosen amount of time

-then you must try to replicate that matrix (should i have a timeout clock here?)

-this is compared to the original matrix and you are given a score based on getting the locations right and based on getting the symbols right. (Each position is, thus worth a possible 2 points).

-after being presented with your score, you then have the option to play again with the same settings, change your settings, or quit.
